# Pern Stack Development
PERN Stack uses four technologies such as PostgreSQL, Express, React, and NodeJS. React is a javascript library for building web apps and it doesnâ€™t load itself in the browser. We need some kind of mechanism that loads the index.html (single page) of React application with all the dependencies(CSS and js files) in the browser. In this lab, I will be using node as the webserver which loads React assets and accepts any API calls from the React UI app.
